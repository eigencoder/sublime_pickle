# sublime_pickle
Sublime plugin to load and edit Python pickle files


Warning:
Saving a pickle file requires Sublime's Python to evaluate every expression in the file. This means it is susceptible to attacks. 
Only use this plugin on safe, known pickles.
If you don't understand this warning, don't use this plugin (or pickles in general)!
